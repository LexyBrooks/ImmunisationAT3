## SA3

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#Let's start with a simple one factor SEM using SA3
 
sadata <- read.csv('sa3_immune.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
#check Titanic read in
str(sadata)
```

```{r}
#change factors of immun to integer or double
num_registered <- as.integer(sadata$num_registered)
str(sadata)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
